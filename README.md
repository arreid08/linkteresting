# Project 3: Linkful

## Project Description:
We will create an app to manage links/bookmarks. A user will login (login authentication only with post mvp) and see a page of their collections. User can open a collection to view all the links or add a new collection. Inside the collection the user can add delete or edit a link. A new link will have a name and a link address. Post MVP add tags and tag search functionality.

User Stories. As _ I want _ so I can _
As an everyday user I want to group my bookmarks so I can be more organized.
As a designer I want to save multiple links so I can review to get ideas, but not overload my bookmarks.
